## About Markel

AI Engineer from Bilbao, Spain. I love building things from scratch—whether it's a ticketing platform, an AI-powered document system, or a real-time event recognition app. Endlessly curious and always eager to ride the wave of what's next in software and AI. First graduating class of the AI degree at UPV/EHU.

- **Belasai.** Developed a grant-winning employee wellness platform for a client using TypeScript, Python, PostgreSQL, fully deployed on AWS with monitoring and automated scaling. [belasai.es](https://belasai.es)
- **DocMind.** Led development of an LLM-based document extraction solution at Devol RPA, reducing manual processing time by 85% for enterprise clients.

## How I Work

- **Gets me pumped:** Shipping fast, building with kind and driven people, seeing users genuinely delighted by something I made.
- **Disappoints me:** Apathy, big egos, over-engineering simple problems.
- **Strengths:** Rapid prototyping, full-stack ownership, turning ideas into production-ready products quickly.
- **Improvement points:** Sometimes move too fast and skip documentation, working on being more deliberate with async communication.
- **Known behaviours / comms style:** Direct and action-oriented, prefer quick calls over long threads, iterate in the open.

### My vision

I want to build products that matter at the intersection of AI and real human needs. The Exponential Fellowship is the perfect launchpad to connect with ambitious builders, learn from world-class mentors, and ship impactful products in the US market. In 5 years, I see myself leading engineering at a high-growth AI startup or building my own company.
